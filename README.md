Geometric Separators and the Parabolic Lift
====================

About:
------

This Processing application is based off the paper [**Geometric Separators and the Parabolic Lift** by Don Sheehy](http://donsheehy.net/research/sheehy13geometric.pdf) and demonstrates basic usage of an algorithm (in the above paper) for finding a geometric separator for 2-D points.

Usage:
------

The application consists of a canvas and two buttons. It will allow you input a number of 2-D Euclidean points using a mouse and calculate the geometric separator. Tentatively, you will also be able to provide a file of predefined points (e.g. .csv format).

Click the mouse anywhere on the canvas to create a new input point. When you have completed your input, either press 'Reset.' to clear it or 'Calculate.' to find the separator.

Features:
---------

The program will visualize several components of the algorithm:

* Highlights the estimated centerpoint for your input.
* Shows the separator in relation to your input.
* Outputs the numerical information associated with the above.
* Perhaps more...
